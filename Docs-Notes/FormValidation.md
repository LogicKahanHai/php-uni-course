# PHP Filters for Validation

PHP provides built-in filter extenstion which includes a range of
filters to sanitize and validate the input.

Examples: -

1. `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` for email addresses
2. `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` for URLs
3. `FILTER_VALIDATE_INT` for Integers.

These filters can help reduce code complexity and provide secure tested native
php code to filter and validate input.
